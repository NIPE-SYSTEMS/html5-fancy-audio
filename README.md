* volume by scrolling on the circle
* elapsed and remaining time of the playback
* filename displayed at the top of the circle (animates if it is too long)
* build with [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) (not for the circle because shadows are too resource-intense)
